# ![logo](/assets/logo.png) devone.space – Your All-in-One Developer Toolkit

🔗 [https://www.devone.space](https://www.devone.space)

**devone.space** is a client-side web app offering a growing collection of **79+ essential tools** built for developers, designers, and creators — all in one clean, categorized interface. No ads, no tracking, just speed.


## 💡 Why devone.space?

As developers, we often juggle multiple tabs just to:
- Format JSON, Markdown, SQL
- Convert Base64, CSV, Images
- Test Regex
- Generate slugs, hashes, mock data
- Run quick AI prompts or IP lookups and many more..

🔁 This wastes time, breaks flow, and adds context switching.

**devone.space** solves this by providing a fast, distraction-free utility suite — available at one URL, with keyboard navigation and tool search.



## ⚙️ Key Highlights

### ✅ All Client-Side (Privacy Focused)
- Most tools run completely in your browser.
- No tracking, no ads, no analytics.

### 🔐 Safe API Usage
- AI-related tools (OpenAI, Gemini) and IP Lookup use external APIs.

## 👨‍💻 Built by

Hi, I'm **Malhar Chauhan** — an indie dev who got tired of juggling 10+ tabs to get small things done.

This project is a blend of what I needed every day, and what I wish existed as a focused toolbox. Hope you find it useful!
